#summary Voltron is a Library for drawing volumes in processing.

= Introduction =

Voltron is a processing library for drawing volumes in processing.  It was developed as part of a module in Basic Techniques for the MRes in Digital Media at Culture Lab Newcastle


= Details =

The library is packaged with source if you want to check it over and tell me how to make it better.  It also has a few examples.  Just put it in the libraries folder in your sketches folder for processing and import at the top of the sketch.

When importing it might import a lot of libraries - needs fixing!

It will work with just:

import NewcasteDigitalMedia.dataprole.voltron.*;

and of course openGL.


This is the first library I have ever written - so expect there to be plenty to fix, i look forward to contributions and suggestions!
