Projects:
  * ofxvolTron - WILL BE BACK SOON-IS ENJOYING A CLEAN UP AND ADDED FUNCTIONALITY - OpenFrameworks addon for plotting voxel pointclouds.  Just use as you would any other addon in OF.  Large example sketch contains a dataset to get you started.

  * voltron - processing library for plotting voxel pointclouds - FINALLY FIXED and working with latest version of processing, tested on version 1.2.1.

1) Download

2) unzip and remove '_1.1.0' version information_

3) place in the 'libraries' folder in your sketchbook

4) plot stuff

NB - some changes worth noting mainly for people who used the library previously.
-use 'voltron' NOT 'volTron' when calling - so OLD EXAMPLES will NOT work without some tweaks.
-plotVox is now overloaded with extra functionality for different drawstyles in openGL points, lines etc.  (see the reference in the download.
